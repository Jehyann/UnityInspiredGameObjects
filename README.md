# UnityInspiredGameObjects
This project is designed to facilitate advanced learning in C++ programming, with a strong emphasis on object-oriented programming (OOP), unit testing, and 2D mathematics (vectors).
I did this project by myself for a school project.

# Learning Objectives:
Throughout this project, students will gain proficiency in the following areas:
- **C++:** Explore and apply advanced concepts in the C++ programming language.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Develop a deep understanding of OOP principles and apply them to real-world coding scenarios. Concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism will be emphasized.
- **Unit Testing:** Learn how to create comprehensive unit tests to ensure code reliability and correctness.
- **2D Mathematics (Vectors):** Gain proficiency in working with 2D mathematical vectors, which are fundamental for many graphics and game development applications.

# Project Details:
The project consists of three distinct components:
- **Mathematical Class:** Develop a mathematical class capable of storing 2D vectors in memory, including X and Y components. Utilize templates to enable these components to be of different types, such as int, float, and more.
- **C++ Container Class:** Create a C++ container class with functionalities similar to the standard std::vector. This class should enable the storage of elements in a dynamic array using templates to handle elements of various data types.
- **GameObject Class:** Implement a GameObject class that serves as a container for various elements of a game object, including its coordinates. This class should be designed to easily accommodate the addition of new elements by creating child classes. It draws inspiration from Unity's GameObject class.
- **Colliders Class:** Develop a Colliders class for collision detection between objects, specifically square and circle shapes. This class should notify the corresponding GameObject of collisions.

To support this project, a Visual Studio solution with three projects will be provided: a library project containing the required classes, a console project for testing these classes, and a unit testing project for thorough testing of the classes.

# Challenges:

Create a flexible and scalable architecture.
Understand the intricacies of meta-programming.
Prevent the occurrence of bugs.
Manage memory efficiently based on project requirements.
Provide necessary testing tools for other programmers.
This project aims to provide a comprehensive learning experience in C++ and OOP while also introducing practical aspects such as unit testing and game development concepts.
